<b>Oath of the Sabbat</b>== ==Of my own free will and accord, I, (name), son/daughter of Caine, reject the Antediluvians and dedicate myself to their destruction. I swear my soul to the Sabbat, and damn all those who stand against us. Hear me, brothers and sisters! Your enemies are my enemies. Your victories, my victories. Your blood, my blood. So shall it be, until the end of all things.

Your Imperial Majesty,==I am Zennabar, the Dragon, Sidhe of the Freehold of Burlington, Vermont, Monarch of the Kingdom of Apples. As the eldest Fey in all of New England and the Mid Atlantic, I have come to your party for my own amusement, and *humbly* request your hospitality.
<size=3>Our sect is one of Freedom. True Freedom, not like those Camarilla-lite "Anarchs" claim to have. You see, our Dark Father lived as a slave in mortal life. He did all he could to please Him Above, going so far as to sacrifice the First Part of his Joy; his own brother. That, my friends, is devotion and love. And what did he get for his display of love? His master cast him aside, forcing Caine to walk the Darkness of Nod! I. The Darkness he met Lilith, who clothed him, fed, him, and cured him of his loneliness. But our Father realized this was just more of the same. If you'll forgive the parable, he knew he needed to learn how to fish, not just be fed. And so he asked Lilith to teach him what would become the first Disciplines, saying "...a life without power will not be worth living. I would die without your gifts. I will not live as your Thrall." Death over servitude! Some say that Caine's actions were born of Pride, but is it prideful to not want to be punished for doing your best? Is it prideful to not be forced to rely on the kindness of another? Caine did not have Pride, and so that is what we are for; The Pride of Caine!</size>
<size=3><b>Blood of Caine, Rise</b>==Beneath the moon, we gather near, With fangs and claws, our truth is clear, No chains to bind, no laws to break, For we are wolves, and wolves awake.  The Camarilla fears the night, But we are fire, we are the fight, They hide in masks, they cower and lie, While we hunt free beneath the sky.  Blood of Caine, rise from below, In every vein, your power flows, Not to be tamed, nor ruled by kings, But to ascend on broken wings.  We curse the thrones, we mock the wise, We see their death within their eyes, The Antediluvians' grip shall break, And from their bones, our world we’ll make.  Oh, hear us, Caine, your chosen speak, We rend the strong, we crush the weak, In darkness bright, we claim our fate, For we are death, and death won’t wait.  Through flesh we carve, through night we tread, No peace, no rest, no final bed, We live, we burn, we dare, we rise, And feast upon their hollow lies.  The Palla Grande is our feast, Where all who kneel become the beast, So drink the blood, embrace the flame, And rise anew, in Caine’s own name.</size>
<size=4>My Dear Banged Fanger and Fanged Bangers, we are gathered here to honor our dear Big Papa caine, Can I get yeehaw on this most spookiest of the months?
