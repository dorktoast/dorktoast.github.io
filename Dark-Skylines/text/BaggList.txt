To all members of the Camarilla to whom these letters may come, GREETING:

After convening in an emergent session, and following the directive of the Inner Council, it is our duty and privilege to announce the appointment of a new Justicar. In light of recent events and the pressing need for strong, strategic leadership, the Inner Council has entrusted this critical role to Ragnar Madison Black, commonly known as "Ragnar the Jackal", of the Clan Gangrel, Pack Master of the Coyotes of Eurasia, many of whom follow him into the Camarilla.

In honor of this momentous appointment, His Grace Ragnar Black issues his first <i>Command</i>: 

- Any Gangrel who wish to join the Camarilla may do so without serving the traditional one year probationary Greater status ban.
- Gangrel who are Autarkis who were members of the Sabbat within the last 10 years who join the Camarilla may do so without facing a Lesser Status ban.
- Finally, that all Gangrel of the Camarilla, being restored as a Pillar of the Ivory Tower, have their lesser status bans lifted.

Let it be known that Ragnar Black now assumes his duties as Justicar, and we call upon all members of the Camarilla to extend their support and cooperation to him.

The Ivory Tower stands strong, eternally.

Signed:

Their Graces
The Justicars of the Camarilla
