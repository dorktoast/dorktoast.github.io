NON-NEGOTIABLE, BINDING TERMS OF SERVICE, UPDATED JUNE 7, 1992

1. Agreement to Nonsense
By accepting these terms, you acknowledge and consent to the inherent nonsense. Should you find any portion of this document to be unreasonable or unrelated, remember: ok
Furthermore, by entering this event, you acknowledge that sanity is a mere illusion, and you willingly embrace the chaos that lies ahead. All perceptions, delusions, and hallucinations experienced within are purely fictional. Or are they?

2. Limitation of Liability
We are not responsible for any mental gymnastics, cognitive dissonance, or temporary insanity that may occur during gameplay. Side effects may include but are not limited to: seeing invisible friends, hearing voices that arenâ€™t there, and sudden, inexplicable evacuation of bowels.

4. Temporal Confusion Clause
All attendees must agree that time is an illusion, and therefore, all dates and deadlines in this document are subject to the whims of the collective subconscious. Be prepared to attend the conclave both yesterday and tomorrow, but never today.

3. Mandatory Obscure References
You are required to make at least one reference per hour to an event, person, or concept that has not been relevant for at least 200 years. Examples include: the Great Fire of London, the invention of the Spinning Jenny, and the War of Jenkins' Ear. Quotes from The Fugitive are also acceptable.

3b. I didn't kill my wife!

F. Nonlinear Logic Acceptance
You must accept that A leads to B, but B can sometimes lead to Z, which may circle back to A if the moon is full. This understanding is crucial for participating in any discussions at the conclave.

G. Third-Eye Limited Warranty
Our clan comes with a limited warranty on your third eye. Should it malfunction, blink uncontrollably, or reveal disturbing visions, please consult your nearest Malkavian primogen. We guarantee a 50% chance of a non-fatal solution.

VII. Non-Disclosure of Reality
You agree to keep the nature of this experience confidential. Discussing the true nature of reality with non-Malkavians is strictly prohibited. Breach of this clause may result in paradoxical encounters with Nosferatu pranksters.

14. Presence
Before any powers of Presence may take effect, all available judges (you know who you are) must rate the user on 1-10, with 1 being "fugly" and 10 being Actual Ryan Reynolds.

C. The first time I met your mother, we were little more than children

Triangle. Unrelated Tangents Policy
At any point during the conclave, you may be asked to discuss the migratory patterns of unladen European swallows or the impact of disco music on the socio-economic structure of the late 20th century. These tangents are not to be questioned.

BG. Staying Alive.
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around Since I was born. And now it's alright, it's okay. And you may look the other way. We can try to understand. The New York Times' effect on man.

\&NumList##. Random Acts of Kindness
While participating in the game, you must perform at least three random acts of kindness per lunar cycle. These acts may include but are not limited to: offering unsolicited wisdom to strangers, sharing cryptic prophecies, and organizing spontaneous poetry slams.

3c. They killed my wife!

[Insert Number]. Random Acts of Confusion
All attendees must perform at least one random act of confusion per day. This could involve speaking in tongues, interpreting tea leaves during a serious debate, or spontaneously playing a kazoo during silent moments.

H. Madness Horse.
There is no madness horse. What the fuck are you talking about

13. Blood Doll Safety
Any blood dolls encountered are for entertainment purposes only. Remember to always ask for consent before feeding. We promote ethical consumption of vitae.

57. What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will 

F. Nightmares
By accepting these terms, you agree to experience nightly nightmares curated by the Malkavian network. These nightmares are designed to unsettle and disturb, ensuring you never truly find peace in sleep.

4. Dated References
You are encouraged to frequently reference technological marvels such as the telegraph, steam engines, and the printing press. Mention of any technology post-1950 must be accompanied by a dramatic sigh and a nostalgic anecdote about the good old days.

$$$. VIGILANCE.
You must remain vigilant at all times, watching for signs of the "Invisible Watchers." Failure to acknowledge their presence will result in a visit from the unseen, leaving you with inexplicable marks and memories.

W. Blame Ventrue

You agree to experience overwhelming guilt for actions you have committed. The Black Hand will be contacting you after these brief messages from our sponsors.

Moon. Mandatory Dream Journal
Each attendee must maintain a detailed dream journal, documenting all nocturnal visions, cryptic messages, and surreal encounters. These journals will be shared and analyzed at random intervals to uncover hidden patterns and divine revelations.

M. Malkav in a fursuit

B(7)4f. Eccentric Entrances and Exits

YES. Acceptance of Unreasonable Terms
By clicking "I ACCEPT" below to accept this agreement, you acknowledge that the terms herein are unreasonable, impractical, and almost certainly illegal in certain jurisdictions.
