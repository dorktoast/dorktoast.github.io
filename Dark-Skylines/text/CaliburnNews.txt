<b>Fort Camlann Reappears on Pearl Island!</b>

This morning, a group of sailors aboard the SS Massachusetts made an astonishing discovery while passing Pearl Island: an ancient, long-forgotten Fort overlooking the mouth of Maiden Bay. Research suggests it is known as Fort Camlann, once a key British stronghold during the American Revolutionary War. The fort was believed to have crumbled into obscurity centuries ago. But to the sailors' disbelief, the fort appeared intact, standing tall as though it had never been abandoned.

Fort Camlann, named after the legendary final battle of King Arthur, was built in the late 18th century by British forces to monitor the surrounding coastline, including Caliburn Island. Historical records suggest that the fort saw brief action before falling into disrepair. Over time, its ruins were thought to have completely eroded, leaving only faint memories and fragmented documentation. Yet, as of this morning, the fort looks almost untouched by time, leading to widespread speculation about its sudden and mysterious reappearance.

Local historian Dr. Eliza Harper expressed her surprise, “This defies all known history of the region. Fort Camlann should not exist in this state—it’s as if it’s emerged from some hidden corner of time.”

The reappearance of Fort Camlann raises numerous questions. How could a fort, thought to be nothing more than ruins, suddenly materialize in near-pristine condition? Some experts have suggested the possibility of a natural or supernatural phenomenon. Others are considering whether ancient magical forces connected to the island's history may have played a role. Caliburn Island, only miles away, is a known hotspot for strange and supernatural occurrences, leading to further intrigue.

Pearl Island itself has long been associated with mysterious happenings, but nothing on this scale has been witnessed before. Government officials have yet to make an official statement, but local maritime authorities have dispatched a reconnaissance team to further investigate the fort.
As the people of the New England coastline brace themselves for more news, one thing is clear—Fort Camlann has returned, and with it, the secrets of the past may soon be revealed.
Stay tuned for updates as this story unfolds.

<b>Violence Erupts as Boston Brutes and Avalon Angels Clash with Rival Gangs</b>

The streets of Messina were once again rocked by violence this week as the Boston Brutes launched another assault on Steel Titans territory. Gunfire rang through the industrial district as workers and commuters scrambled for cover, seeking refuge in nearby factories and dumpsters. Despite the chaos, reports suggest that the Steel Titans, entrenched in their stronghold, successfully repelled the Brutes. The lack of any new markings or shifts in control points to another victory for the well-fortified Titans, who continue to defend their turf from the island's more aggressive factions.

Meanwhile, on the opposite side of Avalon City, the notorious Avalon Angels made a bold move in Long West. Riding in force, the gang stormed the district, seizing control from the Chrome Reapers. Insider sources claim the Angels' objective was to push out the black market dealers who had long operated under Reaper protection. Residents, weary of the Reapers' violent grip, are cautiously optimistic that the Angels' takeover could lead to a reduction in crime and theft, as the more calculated gang establishes its hold on the area.
