<b><i>From the desk of His Royal Highness William Bagg, Seneschal of the Island of Caliburn</b></i>

Orders: Declaration of the Blood Hunt

By the power vested in me as Seneschal of Caliburn Island, and under the directive of His Imperial Majesty Prince William Biltmore, I hereby issue the following orders with immediate effect:
<b>1. Declaration of the Blood Hunt.</b> A Blood Hunt is hereby declared against Darius Marcus of Clan Ventrue, effective immediately. Darius Marcus is declared <i>Forsaken</i> for grievous breaches against our laws and the Masquerade, actions that threaten the safety and secrecy of our kindred society. These include, but are not limited to:
- Loyalty to Leto of Clan Ventrue, of the Camarilla Red List,
- Violation of the Tradition of Domain by impersonating Elder Kelson O’Dell and visiting the haven of Baron Sammie Okra in an attempt to destabilize relations between the Camarilla and Anarch Movement,
- Violations of the Traditions of Progeny and Accounting by siring at least one other kindred without permission of his Elder,
- Violation of the Tradition of Destruction by attempting to bring Final Death upon loyal members of the Camarilla and its allies
- Other grievous crimes against His Imperial Majesty’s Domain.
<b>2. Objectives.</b> All kindred under the domain of Caliburn Island are authorized and compelled to participate in the hunt for Darius Marcus. The primary objective is the capture and/or neutralization of the target to answer for his crimes. Secondary objectives include the gathering of any intelligence related to the accused's allies, resources, and recent activities.
<b>3. Rules of Engagement.</b> The hunt shall be conducted with utmost discretion to maintain the Masquerade. Any breaches will be met with severe consequences. Use of mortal assets is permitted but should be exercised with caution to avoid undue attention.
<b>4. Coordination and Communication.</b> All actions and sightings related to the Blood Hunt must be reported directly to the Seneschal's office for coordination. A central command post will be established at *Le Château Souverain* for the duration of the hunt. Secure communication channels will be provided upon request.
<b>5. Rewards and Recompense.</b> The kindred who delivers Darius Marcus to me,, or provides conclusie proof of having been the hand which brought him the Final Death, shall be declared the victor. The prize of the Amaranth is *Sanctioned* for claim by the victor, that the blood of this traitor may be used to strengthen us.
<b>6. Conclusion of the Hunt.</b> The Blood Hunt shall remain in effect until Darius Marcus meets the Final Death. Any further developments or orders will be communicated with due haste.
<b>7. Acknowledgment of Orders.</b> All members of the Camarilla should acknowledge receipt and understanding of these orders. Failure to comply with the directives of the Blood Hunt will be considered a breach of fealty to the Prince and will be dealt with accordingly.

So ordered,

Willaim Bagg
Seneschal of Caliburn
