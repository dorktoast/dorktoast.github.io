For hundreds of years, vampires clung to the shelter of cities, hiding themselves among mortal man. The wilderness was too untamed for all but the most savage and the most hardy.

Protean was essential to vampiric survival in the Middle Ages, and even in modern nights, it remains one of the most cinematic and renowned disciplines of the children of Caine.
