<b>Be responsible with between-game scenes:</b>

- Your character could get killed.
- It's ok to set up meetings but it should not be something people "wander" up to. (We may implement sign-ups.)
- There should always be threat of the Masquerade.
- If you use blood/resources you come into game with those spent.
- You do not get XP.
- It is equivalent to running a scene via discord DM and carries the same risks.
- You may need to call a freeze and wait for a narrator which may take time.
